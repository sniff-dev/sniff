# Quickstart

Get your first AI agent running with Docker in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- A Linear workspace (admin access for webhooks)
- An Anthropic API key

## Step 1: Clone and Configure

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/caiopizzol/sniff.git
cd sniff

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

```bash
# .env
LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=lin_api_xxxxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx
```

<Note>
  Get your Linear API token from [Linear Settings →
  API](https://linear.app/settings/api). Get your Anthropic API key from
  [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com).
</Note>

## Step 2: Create Agent Configuration

Create a `sniff.yml` file (or use the default):

```yaml
version: "1.0"

agents:
  - id: "triage-bot"
    name: "Triage Assistant"
    description: "Classifies and prioritizes incoming issues"

    system_prompt: |
      You are a triage specialist for an engineering team.

      When a new issue is created:
      1. Classify as: bug, feature, question, or task
      2. Set priority: P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low)
      3. Suggest relevant labels
      4. Provide brief reasoning

      Be concise and decisive.

    model:
      anthropic:
        name: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
        temperature: 0.3
        max_tokens: 1500
```

## Step 3: Start the Server

```bash
docker compose up
```

You should see:

```
sniff  | Loading configuration...
sniff  | Configuration loaded
sniff  | Initializing Linear platform...
sniff  | Linear platform initialized
sniff  | Server is running!
sniff  |
sniff  | Agents:
sniff  |   - Triage Assistant (triage-bot)
sniff  |
sniff  | Webhooks:
sniff  |   - POST http://localhost:3000/webhook/linear
```

## Step 4: Configure Linear Webhook

1. Go to **Linear Settings** → **API** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **New Webhook**
3. Set the URL to your server: `http://your-server:3000/webhook/linear`
4. Select events: **Issue** (create, update)
5. Click **Create**

<Tip>
  For local development, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose your local
  server: ```bash ngrok http 3000 ``` Then use the ngrok URL for your webhook.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Test It Out

Create an issue in Linear. Your agent will automatically respond with its analysis.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Server won't start">
    Check that your environment variables are set:
    ```bash
    echo $LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    ```
    Both should print values (not empty).
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhook not receiving events">
  - Verify the webhook URL is accessible from the internet - Check Linear
  webhook settings show "Active" status - Look at server logs for incoming
  requests
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent not responding">
    - Check server logs for errors
    - Verify the issue event type is selected in webhook settings
    - Ensure your Anthropic API key has credits
